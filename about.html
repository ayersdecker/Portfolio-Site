            <p>I'm a professional Software Developer based in Binghamton, New York. I hold an Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree in Mobile Application Development from the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>
            <p>My background is diverse; I've been a lifelong Boy Scout, participated in sports like Soccer, Baseball, and Bowling, and I have a strong passion for history, especially the achievements of historical polymaths.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me pursuing various hobbies. I enjoy motorcycling, spending quality time with my kids, creating apps, and listening to a wide range of music. I'm also an avid gamer and have a soft spot for titles like Starfield, Destiny 2, Phasmophobia, and Risk of Rain 2.</p>
            <p>My professional interests lie in cross-platform frameworks and XAML, and I love exploring the lives of historical polymaths who made significant contributions to various fields.</p>
            <p>One of my all-time favorite songs is "Don't Say It Wasn't Love" by Blue October, and my top movie pick is Blade Runner 2049. When it comes to TV shows, I have a particular fondness for The Mentalist.</p>
