            <p><span class="tab">My name is Decker Ayers. I am 24 years old, and a software developer from Owego, NY. I spend most of my time either hanging out with my kids, working on various programming projects, gaming, or riding my motorcycle around back roads. As a kid, I was a Boy Scout with my local troop. Often weâ€™d go backpacking, volunteering, and have fun with other organizations who we participated with. </span></p>
            <p><span class="tab">I am currently a student at Rochester Institute of Technology, studying Mobile Application Development. A lot of my project work is geared around building accessible tools for persons with disabilities. I plan to graduate Spring, 2024 with my applied associates. </span></p>
            <p><span class="tab">I am passionate about the ideals of open-innovation/ open-source. Giving others the tools we make public, in the spirit of consideration and progress. </span></p>
            <p><span class="tab">Fun Fact: I have a rare dual recessive genetic disorder called Usher Syndrome. It causes progressive vision loss (Retinitis Pigmentosa), moderate/severe hearing loss, and some other phenomena. This is just a part of my life, it does not make me angry, upset, or wallow. It keeps me sane, knowing that life will always be interesting.</span></p>
