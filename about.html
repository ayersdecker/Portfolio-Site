            <h2>Decker Ayers</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>While I was born in the Adirondacks, I spent most of my younger life in Owego, NY. I come from a middle-class family that includes my mother, father, and older sister whom I often teased. As a child, I was an active individual who participated in a variety of activities, including being a Boy Scout, playing sports, and engaging in community service. If I had to sum up my childhood in one word, I would say "radiating."</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>I have always had an interest in great innovators and inventions as a kid, my favorite by far being Benjamin Franklin. Without a clear idea of what I wanted to do when it came to the [ “ ]real[ “ ] world, I basically did everything growing up. It was interesting taking elective classes in high school for Engineering, Photography, Game Design, Videography, 3D modeling, Networking, and Digital Electronics. Once I graduated, I kind of lost my footing. I attended SUNY Canton for Emergency Management, which turned out to not be a right fit for me. I withdrew from my degree after the end of my second semester, and began to work as a NYS Regional TRAID Director out of Binghamton, NY. </p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>A couple years later, after starting a family and moving closer to my children’s maternal family, COVID-19 hit our world by storm. Working through the conditions became an impossible task, especially as a new parent. I was then so fortunate to receive help from my family to get back on my feet and attend school again in search of a better career. I enrolled in Corning Community college in the Fall of 2020, for Computer Science. I kept my mind open to different fields that I thought I may be interested in pursuing. Finally, during the Spring Semester, I was enrolled in an Intro to Programming course learning C/C++. I absolutely loved it. I was back in the shoes of my younger self again, excited to learn! I immediately knew this would be my passion, so I took a chance and applied to RIT for Mobile Application Development. And this brings me to where I am today.</p>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>I love to code cool stuff. I am a wiz when it comes to UI development, I like making apps that solve a need for others, and best of all, I enjoy what I do! I also tutor for my school's Information Computing Science department, mostly helping with C# instruction. I just love the idea that I can fix a problem for everyone with a little bit of software in their pants pocket. Now I am sure you’d love to hear more about my ideas and experience written down, but why don’t we try a different approach. Check out these pages I made showcasing my different projects over the years. If you have questions or want to hear more about my journey, please let me know!</p>

            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p><span class="tab"></span>Did you know that I have a condition called Usher’s Syndrome? This dual-recessive inherited disorder causes a range of issues, most of which deal with both hearing and vision. I have needed hearing aids since a young child, and when I became a teenager, I had to deal with a significant amount of vision loss. It was at this point I was diagnosed with Retinitis Pigmentosa as a result of Usher’s. Though this condition may seem scary or daunting to many, for me, its just a part of life. There are many things I can’t do, like join the military or see the stars at nighttime. But what I can do is take control over what really matters to me. I strive to live a fantastic life full of opportunity and happy memories. This notion helps drive my code too! We have access to devices with all sorts of tools that can be leveraged to help others reach their goals in life. Be sure to check out my accessible applications on my Projects Page!</p>
